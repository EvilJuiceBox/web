            <p>Traditionally, Electronic Control Units (ECUs) in vehicles have been left unsecured. Ensuring cybersecurity in an ECU network is challenging as there is no centralized authority in the vehicle to provide security as a service. While progress has been made to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities, many of these approaches have focused on enterprise, software-centric systems and require more computational resources than typically available for onboard vehicular devices. Furthermore, vehicle networks have the additional challenge of mitigating security vulnerabilities while satisfying safety and performance constraints. This article introduces a blockchain framework which uses extra onboard computing power to detect unauthorized modifications to vehicle ECUs. A proof of concept blockchain prototype framework is implemented on a set of microprocessors (comparable to those used by simple ECUs) as a means to assess the efficacy of using our blockchain approach to detect unauthorized updates</p>
