                <div class="description">CSE435 teaches students the importance of structured software engineering. For many students, this course is the first to address / discuss safety-critical systems and the dangers of poor software. We discuss the large number of stakeholders in software engineering. We teach software process models such as waterfall, V-model, Spiral model, Agile, etc., with an emphasis on verification and validation of the software product. Furthermore, we teach a number of diagram notations (e.g., class models, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, use-case diagrams, etc.) from the Uniform Modelling Language. During each semester, students are given a real-world safety-critical project from our industrial collaborators, including adaptive cruise control systems, hands free driving systems, lane management systems, etc. They develop a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document, design / implement a prototype, and present their work for our industrial collaborators!</div>

                <div class="description">"In learning you will teach, and in teaching you will learn" - Phil Collins. I strongly believe that a good teacher is one who is always looking to learn and share their knowledge with others. As part of my devotion to the growth of knowledge, I have been voluntary mentoring / tutoring a number of students since 2015 for a wide range of STEM related subjects. They include, but are not limited to Calculus, statistics, linear algebra, data, machine learning, Software Engineering, chemistry, etc. I take high-level and complex concepts and break them down into easily understandable concepts, connecting the dots for my students.</div>
