            <div class="description">CSE435 teaches students the importance of software engineering. For many students, this course is the first to address / discuss safety-critical systems and the dangers of poor software. We discuss the large number of stakeholders in software engineering. We teach software process models such as waterfall, V-model, Spiral model, Agile, etc., with emphasis on verification and validation of the software product. Furthermore, we teach a number of diagram notations (e.g., class models, sequence diagrams, state diagrams, use-case diagrams, etc.) from the Uniform Modelling Language. During each semester, students are given a real-world safety-critical project from industry, ranging from adaptive cruise control systems, hands free driving systems, lane management systems, etc. They develop a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document and design / implement a prototype for our industrial partners!</div>
